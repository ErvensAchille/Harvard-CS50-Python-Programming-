# there are functions in python 
print("Hello world!")


# to run code you must enter terminal and type in python3 hello.py or python3 filename.py
# python supports variables and in order to assign a new value to a variable. 
# Types of variables include whole numbers, integers, booleans, none types and strings, floating numbers for decimals. There are more types. 

# Variables:
a= 28 
b= 1.5 
c= "Hello!" 
d= True
e= None 

# When you press Shift + Enter in VS Code while editing a Python file, the Python terminal opens with the >>> prompt. This is the interactive Python shell (also known as the Python REPL), which is different from running a Python script. The interactive shell lets you execute Python code line by line, and that's why you're seeing the output immediately after typing commands.
# Here's how you can distinguish between running code in the interactive shell vs. executing your entire script:
# 1. Interactive Shell (REPL)
# What happens: When you press Shift + Enter, the code is sent to the interactive Python shell (>>>). This allows you to execute commands line by line, and see the output instantly.
# Why this happens: Shift + Enter is a shortcut to send the current line or selected code to the REPL. This is helpful for quick testing of small snippets of code.
# Example of REPL:

# python code
# >>> c = "Hello!"
# >>> print("Hello world!")
# Hello world!

# 2. Running the Entire Python Script
# What happens: If you want to run your entire Python script (e.g., hello.py), you need to use a different method. This will execute the whole file at once, as if you were running it from the command line.
# How to do it:
# Run using Python: Run Python File option: Press Ctrl + F5 (or Cmd + F5 on Mac) or click on the green "Run" button in the top-right corner of the editor. This will run the entire file in the terminal.
# Use the terminal: Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + \ backtick `) and run the script with python3 or python:
# bash
# python3 hello.py
