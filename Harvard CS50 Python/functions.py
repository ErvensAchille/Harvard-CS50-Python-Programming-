# using for loop in squares file example to show how to access function 
# from another file see full example below lines 12-16

# to declare function in python you use the convention of "def"
# for I in range 10 do some loop 10 times from 0-9. 
# each time we loop we are are going to print out the 
# value of i input and its squared value by accessing the square function 

# def square (x):
#     return x*x

# for i in range (10):
#     print (f"the square root of {i} is {square(i)}")
